			<h2>Developing</h2>
			<p>Computer technology is a technology that instead of building a
				physical machine for each application builds a logical or virtual
				machine.The logical machine is general purpose and can be put to any
				specific problem.Each specific problem is implemented in the logical
				machine by software. Software is thus the most important element of
				computer technology.Software enables the mass production of cheap
				mass-produced physical machines that can be turned to any
				application, rather than building expensive special-purpose
				hardware.Not only that, but software is flexible and can be improved
				with new features over time without the need to replace the original
				physical machine only the logical machine is changed and this is
				cheap to distribute (now over the network, so nothing physical needs
				to be produced or shipped).An important fact of computing is that
				with just a few facilities the complete power of computing can thus
				be realised. No machine can do magic instructions that makes it more
				powerful than others. Interaction with the physical world is a
				little different, but all machines with the basic functionality are
				equivalent at the software level.The important thing about this is
				that all machines can be translated into other machines. This is
				important about producing software high-level languages which
				express problem domains can be translated to machine-oriented
				executable programs.I am interested in programming</p>
